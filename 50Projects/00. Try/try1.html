    There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500 varieties of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of apples, oranges, and other well-known fruit, we are faced with thousands of choices.

    One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the variety available in each country. I live near London, in an area which is known for its apples.

    When travelling in Asia, I was struck by how many different kinds of banana were available - many of which had unique flavours and which were only avaiable within a small region.
